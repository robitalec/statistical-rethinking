## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Learning bayesian data analysis with the Statistical Rethinking textbook
and online lectures. The original version followed the 2019 lectures, and
I am in progress of working through the 2022 lectures and associated homework
with the [statistical rethinking colearning 2022 group](https://github.com/robitalec/statistical-rethinking-colearning-2022).

## Approach  {.unnumbered}

For Chapters 1-4, I use `quap` from the `rethinking` package, following
along with the book and solutions. For Chapters 5-10, I use `cmdstanr` and
`stantargets` to benefit from the incredible `targets` package. All wrapped 
up with `bookdown`. Thanks to Richard McElreath for the book and providing
lectures available online. And thanks to all the package and Stan developers. 

See the full [references](#references) for all packages.
