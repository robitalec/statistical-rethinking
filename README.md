## Approach

For Chapters 1-4, I use `quap` from the `rethinking` package, following
along with the book and solutions. For Chapters 5-10, I use `cmdstanr` and
`stantargets` to benefit from the incredible `targets` package. All wrapped 
up with `bookdown`. Thanks to Richard McElreath for the book and providing
lectures available online. And thanks to all the package and Stan developers.
