### Popper

- generate meaningful (not null) hypotheses and predictions and falsify those

### Approach

A framework for developing + using statistical golems

1. Bayesian data analysis
    - uses probability to describe uncertainty
    - "count all the ways data can happen, according to assumptions and the assumptions with more ways consistent with the data are more plausible"
2. Multilevel models
    - Models within models
    - Avoids averaging
    - ...
3. Model comparison
    - Compare meaningful (not null) models
    - Caution: overfitting

## Hypotheses - Process Models - Statistical Models

Any statistical model M can correspond to multiple process models

Any hypothesis H may correspond to multiple process models

Any statistical model may correspond to multiple hypothesis

## Small world / large world

Small world: models have assumptions, bayesian models fit optimally

Large world: real world, no guarantee of optimality

## Example: four marbles

**Setup**

4 marbles, either black or white, with replacement

Possibilities (5) therefore: WWWW, BWWW, BBWW, BBBW, BBBB

Observation: BWB

**Calculate**

Given 3 observations, there are 4 choices, for a total of 64 possibilities

Given we observed both a white and a black marble, possibilities WWWW and BBBB are not valid

At each branch, there are 3 possibilities it can be white and 1 possibility it can be black

Bayesian is additive, at each branch just sum the possibility

BWWW: 3 = 1 * 3 * 1

BBWW: 8 = 2 * 2 * 2

BBBW: 9 = 3 * 1 * 3

**Using new information**

New information is directly integrated into the old information, therefore just multiply it through

So if we take another measure of B, multiply the property through

BWWW: 3 * 1 = 3

BBWW: 8 * 2 = 16

BBBW: 9 * 3 = 27

**Using other information**

Factory says B measures are rare, but minimum of 1 per bag

               Factory info

WWWW 0 since we observed a B

BWWW: 3

BBWW: 2

BBBW: 1

BBBB 0 since we observed a W

Multiply it through

BWWW: 3 * 3 = 9

BBWW: 16 * 2 = 32

BBBW: 1 * 27 = 27

*Counts get huge - therefore we **normalize them giving us probabilities (0-1)***

Probability theory is just normalized counting

## Building a model

1. Design the model 
2. Condition on the data
3. Evaluate, critique the model
4. (Restart)

# Lecture 02

## Joint prior distribution

The joint prior distribution is the prior probability of distribution + parameters

## Example: inflatable world

### **Design the model**

p: water proportion

1-p: land proportion

### **Condition**

Bayes updating: converts priors to posteriors

- Adds all data at once
- All posteriors are the prior for next observation
- Sample size is embodied in the posterior

### **Evaluate**

Golem must be supervised

- Did it malfunction?
- Does the answer make sense?
- ...

### Define parameters

N: fixed by experimentor

W: a probability distribution, in this case a binomial distribution

WLWWLWWLW

`dbinom(6, size = 9, prob = 0.5)`

p: prior probability distribution, in this case uniformed

### Joint model

W ~ Binomial(N, p)

p ~ Uniform(0, 1)

(W is distributed binomially with probability p on each measure, p is uniform at 1)

### Posterior

Posterior = (probability observed variables * prior)  / normalizing constant

(If priors are uniform, they don't affect the shape of the posterior. They may influence the shape though)

## Grid approximation

Grid approximation: consider only a finite discrete set of solutions

For example, 1000 solutions

1. Generate a sequence of solutions  `seq_sol <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000)`
2. Prior = uniform 1 across sequence of solutions `prior <- rep(1, seq_sol)`
3. Probability of data = binomial `prob_data <- dbinom(6, size = 9, prob = seq_sol)`
4. Posterior numerator = `posterior_num <- prior * prob_data`
5. Posterior standardized = `posterior_numerator / sum(posterior_num)`

### Sampling from the posterior

Approximate the posterior, then you can sample from the posteriors `sample(p, prob = posterior, 1e4, replace = TRUE)`

**Summarize**

- above/below some value
- Percentile interval
- Highest posterior density interval
- ...

**Predictive checks**

- `rbinorm(1e4, size = 0, prob = samples)`
- ...

# Lecture 03

## Regressions

- Model of mean and variance of some normally distributed measure
- Mean as additive combination of weighted vairables
- Typical assumed constant variable (???)
- The line returned is the mean - but with bayesian we want to see the distribution of lines, ranked by plausability
- The model endorses the line, but the line doesn't necessarily fit the data
- In regressions there will always be more certainty at the means and bowtie towards the limits of the data
- Regression models don't have arrows like DAGs - they just measure associations.

## Normal distributions

Normal distributions arise when repeated fluctuations tend to cancel near 0

The gaussian distribution is the most conservative distribution to use for a prior, it is the best option if no additional scientific information is available

## Prior predictive distributions

Simulate from the joint posterior distribution and evaluate

1. Setup model with `quap`
2. `prior <- extract.prior(model)`
3. `link(model, post = prior, data = seq)` 
    - where the seq is a sequence of your x variable (eg for standardize -2, 2
4. Plot lines

These are all the possibility give the prior, **not the data**

If the lines show such a limited relationship that you'd expect that the true relationship is outside of these, expand the priors. 

If alternatively they are widely implausible, tighten the priors. 

## Quadratic approximate

In a multidimensional space, QUAP uses gradient climbing to find peaks

Maximum likelihood estimation = QUAP with flat priors

Function in rethinking is `rethinking::quap`

## Centering variables

`x - mean(x)`

Should be default behaviour when doing a regression

# Lecture 04

## Standardizing variables

`(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)` or `scale(x)`

Result = mean of 0, sd of 1

Helps software fit

Value = 1 is equal to 1 SD

## Plotting uncertainty - sample from posterior

(if multivariate normal)

1. Approximate posterior from mean, standard deviation
2. Sample from multivariate normal distribution of parameters
3. Use sampels to generate predictions that integrate over uncertainty

`extract_samples` returns a, b, sigma, ... and you can plot each

## Polynomials

Polynomials have bad behaviour especially at the boundaries of the data

They don't fit locally, and are not actually flexibly. 

Eg. a polynomial of 3rd degree will necessarily have two turns - this has to happen irrespective of the data

## Splines

Locally wiggly functions, combined by interpolation

Geocentric - describing relationships - not exploring them

## Basis splines

Bayesian B-splines = P-splines

Similar to linear models but with synthetic variables

$\mu = \alpha + w_{1} \beta_{1} + + w_{2} \beta_{2} + + w_{3} \beta_{3} + + w_{4} \beta_{4} + ...$

Knots are often picked at equal intervals in data, though strategies vary

At each knot, the knot's function is at 100%, moving away from it, the neighboring functions *turn on*

Parameters always have more uncertainty than predictions

Caution: overfitting

### Recipe

1. Choose knots - points where spline pivots
2. Choose degree of basis functions - how wiggly, polynomial
3. Find posterior distribution of weights

# Lecture 05

## Multiple regression models

Why?

- Spurious associations
- Determining the value of some predictor given other predictors
    - eg. divorce rate given marriage rate and median age at marriage. Once we know marriage rate, what is the value in knowing median age?

## Directed acyclic graphs (DAG)

Directed: arrows, indicating causal implications

Acyclic: no loops

**Unlike statistical models, DAGs have causal implications**

eg. Median age → marriage rate → divorce rate, Median age → divorce rate

## Example: Age, marriage, divorce

$D_{i} \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{i}, \sigma)$

$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{M}M_{i} + \beta_{A}A_{i}$

(M)arriage rate

(A)ge at marriage

(D)ivorce rate

### Priors

Standardize to z-scores 

$\alpha$ = expected value for response when all values are 0. since they are all standardized the response should be 0. Without peaking at the data, this could be hard to guess. But after standardization, it is much simpler. 

Slopes - use prior predictive simulation. Harder. 

### Prior predictive simulation

See [Prior predictive distributions](https://www.statistical-rethinking.robitalec.ca/lecture-03.html#prior-predictive-distributions)

### Interpretation

Once we know median age at marriage, there is little additional value in knowing marriage rate. 

Once we know marriage rate, there is still value in knowing median age at marriage. 

If we don't know median, it is still useful to know marriage rate, since median age at marriage is related to marriage rate. However, we don't want to try and influence eg. policy on marriage rate, since it isn't causal on divorce rate.

## Plotting multivariate posteriors

1. Regress predictor on other predictors
2. Compute predictor residuals
3. Regress outcome on residuals

**Side note: never analyze the residuals.** 

### Posterior predictive checks

Compute implied predictions for observed cases

Again, regressions will always do well in the area around the mean

## Reveal masked associations

Sometimes association between outcome and predictor is masked by another variable

This tends to arise when 2 predictors associated with the outcome have opposite effects on it

## Categorical variables

Two approaches: 

1. Use dummy/indicator variables
2. Use index variables

**Index variables are much better**

### Dummy variable

"Stand in" variable

Eg. male/female column, translated to 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 where 0 female, 1 male

Model: 

$h_{i} \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{i}, \sigma)$

$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{M}M_{i}$

In the case of dummy variables, alpha is the mean when M = 0 (female) and beta M is the change in mean when M = 1 (male). 

Result is 2 intercepts = where alpha alone is for female and alpha + beta M is intercept for males

Problem: for k categories, need k-1 dummy  variables and need priors for each. also, priors aren't balanced because of alpha vs beta

# Lecture 06

## Index variable

(For unordered, categorical variables)

Starts at 1, counts up

Same prior can be given to all

Extends easily > 2

eg. 

```jsx
m <- quap(
	alist(
		height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a[sex],
		a[sex] ~ dnorm(178, 20),
		sigma ~ dunif(0, 50)
	), 
	data = d
)
```

a[sex] and a for each sex and prior for each. directly in precis(m) too. 

Then you can directly calculate the difference between groups in the posteriors, no need to rerun the model

```jsx
post <- extract.samples(m)
post$diff <- post$a[, 1] - post$a[, 2]
precis(post)

#       mean
# sigma 27
# a[1]  134
# a[2]  142
# diff  -7.7
```

## Four elemental confounds

When inferring the relationships between X and Y...

Confounds are not determined by model selection, so we use DAGs. 

Arrows indicate causation, and statistical information can flow either way. 

### Notes

- Regression models don't have arrows like DAGs - they just measure associations.
- You can't tell the difference between the fork and the path given the data alone.
- Remember DAGs are small world constructs.

### The fork

X ← Z → Y

Z is a common cause of X and Y. Including Z will remove the relationship between X and Y. 

### The path

X → Z → Y

Z is along the path of X and Y, mediating the relationship. 

For example, the influence of treatment on plant height, where treatment has an influence on fungus. 

T → F → H

Since the treatment influences the fungus (a post treatment measure), if we include both the treatment and the fungus, we will see no relationship of treatment on height, only fungus. (once we know fungus, what does treatment tell us - nothing). In this case, the model with both treatment and fungus tells us the relationship between them, but to properly consider the influence of treatment we need to omit fungus

Therefore, understanding the relationship between T and F is important, but for determining causality of T on H, we need to omit it from that model. 

### The collider

X → Z ← Y

Z is common result of X and Y. X and Y are independent, if you condition on Z. Careful about statistical correlations that do not indicate causation here. 

### Steps

1. List all paths connecting X (treatment) and Y (outcome)
2. Classify each path as either open or closed. All paths are open unless they contain a collider. 
3. Classify each path as backdoor/frontdoor. Backdoor paths have an arrow entering X. 
4. Condition on variables in backdoor paths to close them. 

![Untitled](Statistical%20Rethinking%209648278528c64765bc03ca8a8a8e1f74/Untitled%201.png)

# Lecture 07

## Four elemental confounds (continued)

### Unobserved variables

Careful about unmeasured variables. They can create confounds, without being directly measured. 

Eg. (Haunted DAG). G on C. G → P → C, G → C. But unobserved variable U creates a collider: G → P ← U → C. So including P allows the collider to distort the influence on G on C. 

## Over fitting

Ockham's razor: "plurality should never be posited without necessity"

This isn't sufficient, because we are usually comparing between models that are more complicated but fit the data better, and models that are less complicated but fit worse. 

Two major hazards: too simple, not learning enough from data (under fitting) and too complex, learning too much from data (over fitting)

Goal = to learn from regular features from the sample, those that will generalize to other samples

## Measuring model fit

### R squared

Common, not great

$R_{2} = 1 - \frac{var(residuals)}{var(outcome)}$

"Proportion of variance explained"

You can get R squared = 1 with a parameter for each data point - perfect fit. This is obviously nonsense. 

Therefore there's a trap of picking models solely on their R squared because increase the parameters and you will increase the R squared. 

## Obtaining the regular features

- Regularizing priors
- Cross validation
- Information criteria



# Lecture 08
## Information theory

Information: reduction in uncertainty caused by learning an outcome

Therefore it's a scale of uncertainty, and information theory is a system for deriving a metric of uncertainty

Information entropy: uncertainty in a probability distribution is average the log probability of an event. Uncertainty in a distribution, "potential for surprise"

entropy(p) - entropy(q) is what we are trying to minimize (where p is true, q is model)

## Divergence

$D_{KL} = \sum p_{i} (log(p_{i}) - log(q_{i}))$

- Average difference in log probability between the model q and target p
- It's asymmetrical - recall W/L ratio on Earth → Mars and reverse. Expecting few water events coming from Mars and the reverse coming from Earth
- Since we don't actually know the "truth", we can't use this to directly measure a model
- But turns out - we don't need the truth to compare two models, only their average log probability

## Estimating divergence

This is the gold standard for scoring models

### Log pointwise predictive density

`lppd`

Pointwise measure of average probability that the model expects the data

Using the entire posterior, measures the log probability

Summing the vector of lppd returns the total log probability score

Larger values are better, indicating larger average accuracy

### Deviance

Deviance = lppd score * -2

Smaller values are better

Note: deviance decreases with more parameters, however out of sample deviance is best in the model with the right number of parameters (simulated example)

## Regularization

Must always be skeptical of the sample

Regularization: use informative, conservative priors to reduce overfitting (models learn less from sample). 

This is particularly important for small sample sizes and as a result, for multilevel models. 

## Cross validation

Without *known* out of sample measures, you can estimate out of sample deviance

Model with some samples left out, and average over the estimate of those samples

### LOO

Leave one out 

Pareto-smoothed importance sample (PSIS)

`loo` package

## Information criteria

Historically: AIC, a theoretical estimate of the KL distance

Assumptions of AIC include

- priors are flat or overwhelmed by data
- posterior is essentially gaussian
- sample size >> number of parameters k

### WAIC

Widely Applicable Information Criterion

- Does not assume gaussian posterior

### Standard error

Presented in `rethinking::compare` and available for LOO or AIC comparisons. The standard error is the approximate standard error of each WAIC. Caution: with small sample sizes, the standard error reported underestimates the uncertainty. 

To determine if two models can be distinguished, use the standard error of their difference (dSE). Using the `compare` function, you can get the `@dSE` slot to return a matrix of dSE for each pair of models. 

## Model selection

Avoid model selection

Score models and apply causal inference to use compare competing models to explain

## Model comparison

Model comparison is not causal inference

Add and imagine unobserved confounds

### Example 1: model mis-selection using WAIC

Height 0 → Height 1, Treatment → Fungus → Height 1

F + T, dWAIC = 0

T, dWAIC = 41

intercept = 44

Since f is a pipe on T→F, including it confounds the model

AIC does not indicate causal inference, it simply identifies the best model according to the predicted out of sample deviance

Model comparison AND causal inference are important 

### Example 2: primate lifetime

Body mass → lifespan, Body mass → brain size → lifespan

Relationship of interest: brain size on lifespan

M + B, WAIC = 217

B, WAIC = 218

M = 229

Note: when we have different parameters that return similar WAIC, it's an invitation to poke inside!

Inspecting their estimate posterior we notice that the sign of the brain mass parameter flips from negative to positive across models

**Another approach: since WAIC is pointwise we can plot the difference in WAIC for each point across models**

Comparing life span on Y, and pointwise difference in WAIC between the two models on X

We see that the model M+B is better for some species eg. Cebus, and the simple B model is better for other species eg. Gorilla

Incredible

# Lecture 09

## Conditioning

Interaction of variables on each other

Dependence on the state

eg. Influence of genes on phenotype depends on environement

Approaches

1. Use interacting terms (simplest)
2. Generalized linear models
3. Multilevel models

Interactions arise wherever there is a boundary in the outcome space. All GLMs have interactions. 

In a DAG, an interaction looks like

gene → phenotype ← environment

But DAGs can't fully tell you if it's an interaction

Before interaction terms, all variables are simply independent additive terms. 

### Example: ruggedness

"Ruggedness is bad for the economy outside of Africa, but within Africa is it good"

Reminder - constrain priors to possible outcome space

1. Scale ruggedness between 0, 1
2. Constrain change in GDP bc evidently eg GDP x 2 would be a huge effect

Keep it reasonable

Options

1. Split the data?

Run two linear regressions. This means there is no statistical criteria to measure the split. 

We are interested in the contrast in slope, but to do that we need to use the same model. 

1. Add a categorical variable for Africa?

Use alpha[id] and different estimates for each

This means the slope is forced to be the same, but difference intercepts. 

Relationship is held constant across groups, not what we want. 

1. Interaction

$\mu_{i} = \alpha_{CID[i]} + \beta_{CID[i]}(r_{i} - \bar{r})$

Slope and intercept are allowed to vary for each

### Example: tulips

Tulip blooms, in varying Water and Shade

$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{W}W + \beta_{S}S + \beta_{W * S}W*S$

The beta W*S variable is actually a nested linear model 

## Interpreting interactions

- Interpreting interactions is hard
- The influence of predictors depends upon multiple parameters and their covariation
- Interactions are symmetric within the data.
    - Eg. effect of continent depends on ruggedness is the same as effect of ruggedness on continent
    - Statistically the same
    - We need to apply our outside knowledge and causal information

## Plotting interactions

Use a triptych

Vary shade at -1, 0, 1

Plot bloom as response and water on x

### Higher order interactions

Caution: hard to interpret, hard to estimate

# Lecture 10

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Reminder: bayesian inference is about calculating the posterior. Bayesian ≠ Markov Chains

4 of the ways to compute the posterior

1. Analytical approach (mostly impossible)
2. Grid approximation (very intensive)
3. Quadratic approximate (limited)
4. MCMC (intensive)

Advantages of MCMC

- You don't know the posterior yet you can still visit each part of it in proportion to it's relative probability
- "Sample from a distribution that we don't know"

### Metropolis algorithm

1. Loop over iterations
2. Record location
3. Generate neighbour location proposals
4. Move based on frequency

Converges in the long run, can be used as long as proposals are symmetric

### Metropolis Hastings

Improvement on Metropolis, does not require the proposals to be symmetrical

### Gibbs sampling

More efficient version of MH

### Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

Markov Chain: No memory. Probability solely depends on current state, not past state. No storage. 

Monte Carlo: Random simulation (eg Monaco casino)

MCMC is a numerical technique to solve for the posterior, with several advantages over Metropolis and Gibbs

- Metropolis and Gibbs use optimization but optimization is not a good strategy in high dimensions (see concentration of measure)
- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo uses a gradient to avoid the guess + check of Metropolis and Gibbs
- Especially in high dimensional space, acceptance rate decreases and methods take more time

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo:

1. Uses a physics simulation representing the parameter state as a particle
2. Flicks the particle around a frictionless log-posterior surface
3. Follows curvature of the surface, so it doesn't get stuck
4. Uses random direction and random speed
5. Slows as it climbs, speeds as it drops

This is much more computationally intensive, but requires less steps, has much fewer rejections

It's also easier to determine if MCMC has failed

### Tuning MCMC

Step size: time the simulation is run. Increase step size = increase efficiency but overestimates curvature

U Turn risk is solved by NUTS (No U Turn Sampler)

1. Warm up phase - finding the step size to maximize acceptance rate. Default = good (half the number of samples)
2. Runs in both directions and gives uncorrelated samples. No need to pick leap frog steps

### Stan

Stan uses NUTS

### ulam

1. Create list of data only what you need
2. `ulam` with formulas as in `quap`
3. `ulam` translates the formulas to Stan
4. Builds the NUTS sampler
5. Sampler runs
6. Returns posterior

### Diagnosis

Neff: number of effective samples. Can be greater than the number of samples from the Markov Chan. Effective if no autocorrelation

Rhat: Convergence diagnostic. 1 is good. Ratio of variance within vs ratio of variance across chains. 

"**Typically when you have a computational problem, often there's a problem with your model"**

### Checking the chain

TODO: p283

# Lecture 11

Flat distributions have the highest entropy and have many more ways that they can be realized

## Maximum entropy

Distribution with the largest entropy is the distribution most consistent with stated assumptions

For parameters: helps understand priors. What are the constraints that make a prior reasonable?

For observations: way to understand likelihood

Solving for the posterior = getting the distribution that is as flat as possible and consistent with data within constraints

Highest entropy answer = distance to the truth is smaller

### Distributions

| Constraints | Maxent distribution | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Real value in interval | Uniform | Bird proportions |
| Real value, finite variance | Gaussian | Coin flip |
| Binary events, fixed probability | Binomial | Marble drawing, globe tossing |
| Non negative real, has mean | Exponential | Amount of time until event |

## Generalized linear model

Connect linear model to outcome variable

1. Pick outcome distribution
2. Model its parameter using links to linear models
3. Compute posterior

Extends to multivariate relationships and non-linear responses

Building blocks of multilevel models

Very common and widely applicable

### Picking a distribution

Mostly exponential family because all are maximum entropy interpretations and arise from natural processes

**Do not pick by looking at a histogram -** no way an aggregate histogram of outcomes unconditional on something else is going to have a relevant distribution

Just use principles.


![](exponential-distributions.png)

- Exponential: non negative real. Lambda is a rate and the mean is 1/lambda
- Binomial: count events emerging from an exponential distribution
- Poisson: count events, low rate
- Gamma: sum of exponential
- Normal: gamma with large mean

Tide prediction machine - complex "parameters" at the bottom. "Can understand models if you resist the urge to understand parameters"

### Types of outcomes

Distances and durations

- Exponential
- Gamma

Counts

- Poisson
- Binomial
- Multinomial
- Geometry

Monsters

- Ranks, ordered categories

Mixtures

- Beta binomial
- Gamma-poisson
- Etc

### Model parameters with a link function

Yi ~ Normal(mu, sigma)

mu ~ alpha + beta * X

Linear regressions and only linear regressions have the same scientific units for both the outcome variable and parameters for the mean

Another example - binomial

Count: Y ~ Binomial(N, p) (unit is count of something)

Probability: P ? alpha + beta * X (unitless)

We need some function 

f(p) = alpha + beta * X

## Binomial distribution

Counts of a specific event out of n possible trials

min: 0, max: n

Constant expected value

Maxent: binomial

y ~ Binomial(n, p)

count successes is distribution binomially with n trials and p probability of success

### Link

Goal is to map linear model to [0, 1]

y ~ Binomial(n, p)

logit(p) = alpha + beta * x

logit is the log odds

Given this link function, priors on the logit scale are the not same shape as priors on the probability scale

Prosocial monkey example

y ~ Binomial(n, p)

logit(p) = alpha[actor] + beta[treatment] * Treatment

precis(m)

a[1] ... a[7] a are the different chimps, the posterior means are on the logit scale

b[1] ... b[4] b are the treatments, the average log odd deviations after chimp handedness has been considered

Investigating

1. extract samples
2. inv_logit to transform to probability score
3. precis

It's really hard to understand just using the precis output therefore

1. Plot on the outcome scale with link = posterior predictive sampling

Controlling for handedness here isn't because of the backdoor criterion. Handedness = noise, controlling for it gives us a more precise criteria

# Lecture 12

## Relative and absolute effects

Effect sizes two ways

1. Relative effect scale: parameters have relative differences in their effect
2. Absolute effect scale: used for predictions

Proportional odds eg treatment 4 and 2

post ← extract.samples

mean

0.9 = 90% of previous odds 

Therefore 2→4 expects reduction of odds by 10%

But this disregards base rate

Risk of relative effects like proportional odds is they don't consider absolute likelihood

Relative shark vs absolute deer - need both

## Logistic regression

0, 1 trials (bernoulli trials)

Aggregate binomial: aggregated from each 0, 1 to counts for each category

Example - UC Berkeley 1970s

Gender → Department → Acceptance, Gender → Acceptance

Recall: regressions are very literal to exactly the question you are asking

Model 1

Acceptance ~ Binomial(N, p)

logit(p) = alpha [gender]

Statistical question: what are the average probabilites of admission by gender across all departments?

Causal question: what is the total causal influence of gender?

It's asking for the total effect, not the discrimination effect

Therefore, all paths are in play (Gender → Department → Acceptance, Gender → Acceptance)

Model 2

Close the backdoor. 

Acceptance ~ Binomial(N, p)

logit(p) = alpha [gender] + beta department

Statistical question: what is the average difference in probability of admission for genders within department?

Causal question: what is the direct influence of gender?

These are equally valid, but different questions. 
## Simpsons paradox

Flip of covariates sign when adding/removing a variable


# Lecture 13

## Binomial

Outcome is a count from zero to some known upper bound

## Poisson

Binomial events with N trials large/unknown and probability of event is small

Poisson with varied exposure/offset

## Generalized linear madness

Example of oceanic tool complexity

Modeled with a poisson link

The model outcomes are terrible - though they fit the data, the intercepts don't pass through origina

Wouldn't we expect zero population = zero tools?

Solution is a scientific model

## Scientific model

The relationship can be thought of as a change in tools per unit time

Change in time = alpha P ^ beta

Alpha: innovation rate, P: population per person  = each person has some change of inventing something

Beta: diminishing returns, saturation effect, "someone else will invent it for you"

TODO: read more about this, highlight it, etc

The resulting model using this function based in the scientific model is not perfect, but meanings are clearer, the intercept actually goes through 0

This is an ad hoc function, not a link

## Survival analysis

Estimate rates by modeling time-to-event

Can't ignore censored cases

- Left censored: don't when when time started
- Right censored: something else cut off end

Example cats

Time to adoption for observed adoptions is simplest, an exponential function

For censored cats

1. use the cumulative distribution
2. take the complement
3. calculate probability no event yet

## Monsters

Specialized complex distributions

eg. ordered categories, ranks

## Mixtures

Blends of stochastic processes

eg. varing means, probabilities, rates

eg. zero-inflation, hurdles

Example monks

Number of manuscripts per day

Can we infer the number of days they get drunk?

Drunkenness is a hidden state

There is a probability that they drink or work, and within the work, a probability that they produce 0 or 1+ manuscripts

## Ordered categories

Discrete outcomes with defined order, defined min and max

But the "distances" between categories is unknown and not metric

Hard to model because it isn't continuous and bounded by min-max but not a count. 

Solution: use a log-cumulative-odds link probability model

# Lecture 15

## Multilevel models

Most models forget things about the data as they move from one case to the other

Fixed effects: the model forgets everything between clusters. no information is passed between clusters. 

Multilevel model: remember and pool information

**Default should be multilevel modeling**

- nearly every case is improved by multilevel modeling
- if not, it's just as good

Why use multilevel modeling?

- deal with clustering in data (eg. classroom within schools, students within classrooms, ...)
- handles imbalance in sampling
- handles pseudoreplications

## Varying intercepts

Example tadpole

Outcome: number surviving

Tadpoles in tanks at different densities

Model 1 index for each tank

Model 2 multilevel with varying intercepts

Varying intercepts = random intercepts

"Random" and "varying" unclear

Distinction of varying intercepts is the prior learns from the data 

Adaptive regularization

From the example, survival across tanks has some distribution. This distribution is the prior for each tank. And the distribution needs its own prior

## Shrinkage

Model doesn't retrodict samples exactly

Shrinkage towards the population mean caused by regularization

Larger variation = more shrinkage

Less data per cluster = more shrinkage

Increased difference from mean = more shrinkage

## Pooling

Why are varying effects more accurate than fixed effects?

- Grand mean - maximum underfitting - complete pooling
- Fixed effects - maximum overfitting - no pooling
- Varying effects - adaptive regularization - partial pooling
