## Hypotheses - Process models - Statistical models


Hypotheses are vague. To work with them, we need to transform into process models

Process models are precise and causal. However, different process models can yield different or the same statistical model. 

Statistical models strictly examine associations, not causation.

## Null models

Unique, singular null models are not always feasible, eg. communities, networks and phylogenies.

## Drawing the Bayesian owl

1. Theoretical estimand (precisely defined in:)
2. Scientific causal models
3. Combine theoretical estimate and scientific causal models to build statistical models
4. Simulate scientific causal models to validate statistical models yield theoretical estimand
5. Analyse real data

## Why Bayesian?

* flexible
* express uncertainty at all levels
* direct solutions to measurement error and missing data
* focus on scientific models instead of navigating flowcharts of different models and test - use the same approach for different problems
