The data in data(foxes) are 116 foxes from 30 different urban groups in England. These foxes are like street gangs. Group size varies from 2 to 8 individuals. Each group maintains its own (almost exclusive) urban territory. Some territories are larger than others. The area variable encodes this information. Some territories also have more avgfood than others. We want to model the weight of each fox. For the problems below, assume this DAG 4.1.1 Setup # Packages library(ggdag) library(dagitty) library(data.table) library(ggplot2) library(tidybayes) # DAG dag_plot &lt;- function(dag) { stat &lt;- node_status(dag, FALSE) stat$data$status[is.na(stat$data$status)] &lt;- &#39;intermediate&#39; ggplot(stat, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) + geom_dag_point(aes(color = status), alpha = 0.5, size = 15) + geom_dag_edges() + labs(color = &#39;&#39;) + geom_dag_text(color = &#39;black&#39;) + scale_color_manual(values = list(&#39;exposure&#39; = &#39;#35608DFF&#39;, &#39;outcome&#39; = &#39;#22A884FF&#39;, &#39;intermediate&#39; = &#39;grey50&#39;)) + theme_void() } dag &lt;- dagify( weight ~ groupsize + avgfood, groupsize ~ avgfood, avgfood ~ area, exposure = &#39;area&#39;, outcome = &#39;weight&#39; ) dag_plot(dag) 4.2 Question 1 Use a model to infer the total causal influence of area on weight. Would increasing the area available to each fox make it heavier (healthier)? You might want to standardize the variables. Regardless, use prior predictive simulation to show that your model’s prior predictions stay within the possible outcome range. 4.2.1 Workings Area on weight scale(weight) ~ dnorm(mu, sigma) mu &lt;- a + b * (scale(area)) a: intercept when weight and area are scaled, the expected intercept is 0 therefore a ~ dnorm(0, 0.5) b: beta, rate of change given one unit of increase in area b ~ dnorm(0, 1) sigma: standard deviation uniform prior sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) 4.2.2 Model library(rethinking) data(foxes) foxes$scale_area &lt;- scale(foxes$area) foxes$scale_weight &lt;- scale(foxes$weight) m1 &lt;- quap( alist( scale_weight ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), mu &lt;- a + bArea * scale_area, a ~ dnorm(0, 0.05), bArea ~ dnorm(0, 0.5), sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) ), data = foxes ) 4.2.3 Prior predictive simulation plot_link &lt;- function(DT, n) { data.table(DT)[sample(.N, n), plot(data.table(x = rep(c(-2, 2), .N), y = c(V1, V2)), type = &#39;l&#39;)] } prior &lt;- extract.prior(m1) l &lt;- link(m1, post = prior, data = list(scale_area = c(-2, 2))) plot_link(l, 20) ## NULL 4.2.4 Paths Interest: Area on Weight Paths Area -&gt; Avgfood -&gt; Weight Area -&gt; Avgfood -&gt; Groupsize -&gt; Weight Avgfood and Groupsize are pipes between Area and Weight. There are no backdoors or colliders. 4.2.5 Interpretation Would increasing the area available to each fox make it heavier (healthier)? bArea has a mean of 0.02, with compatibility intervals around 0. Therefore the model does not indicate a total causal influence of area on the weight. precis(m1) ## mean sd 5.5% 94.5% ## a -0.000001 0.044 -0.07 0.07 ## bArea 0.018844 0.091 -0.13 0.16 ## sigma 0.995497 0.065 0.89 1.10 post &lt;- extract.samples(m1) s &lt;- sim(m1, data = list(scale_area = c(-2, 2)), post = post) ggplot(data.table(s), aes(V1)) + stat_halfeye(.width = .89) 4.3 Question 2 Now infer the causal impact of adding food to a territory.

Which covariates do you need to adjust for to estimate the total causal influence of food? bFood has a mean of -0.02, with compatibility intervals around 0. The model does not indicate a total causal influence of area on the weight. No covariates are needed to estiamte the total causal influence of food because there are no backdoors or colliders. 4.4 Question 3 Now infer the causal impact of group size. Which covariates do you need to adjust for? Looking at the posterior distribution of the resulting model, what do you think explains these data? That is, can you explain the estimates for all three problems? How do they go together? 4.4.1 Paths Interest: Group size on weight Paths: Groupsize -&gt; Weight Groupsize &lt;- Avgfood -&gt; Weight Avgfood is a collider between Groupsize and Weight.

Looking at the posterior distribution of the resulting model, what do you think explains these data? That is, can you explain the estimates for all three problems? How do they go together? The Avgfood covariate needs to be included since it is a collider between Groupsize and Weight. The mean and compatibility intervals of bFood are positive, while the mean and compatibility intervals of bGroupsize are negative. This indicates food’s positive relationship with weight could be buffered or interacting with the negative relationship of group size. Increased food leads to increased body weight, but more food also results in larger groups, which decreases the food availability.

Second, use each island’s birb distribution to predict the other two.

Can you explain why the answers to these two questions disagree? compare(m6.9, m6.10) ## WAIC SE dWAIC dSE pWAIC weight ## m6.9 2714 38 0 NA 3.7 1 ## m6.10 3102 28 388 35 2.3 0 Model m6.9 includes marriage while m6.10 does not. The causal influence of age on happiness is confounded by marriage because marriage is a collider between age and happiness. Conditioning on marriage opens the path between age and happiness, making age and happiness independent. Therefore, despite the WAIC for m6.9 being lower, it does not tell us anything about causation between the variables. 5.3 Question 3 Reconsider the urban fox analysis from last week’s homework.

Looking at the DAG, we see a potential back door into avgfood and group size, but no colliders. Avgfood is a path between area and weight, as is groupsize between avgfood and weight. The paths for each variable that does not have confounds shown in the DAG: Model 2: Weight ~ groupsize + avgfood (to determine causal effect of groupsize on weight, including avgfood to open the collider) Model 4: Weight ~ avgfood (to determine causal effect of avgfood, without groupsize confusing the relationship since it’s a pipe) Model 5: Weight ~ area (with avgfood and groupsize excluded) Model 1 includes the most parameters and, as expected, has the highest model fit. The dSE column returned by the compare function indicates the standard error of the difference between models, with the @dSE slot showing this for all combinations of models. Models 4 and 5 barely differ, as there is likely a strong influence of area on average food. Including both area and avgfood is like conditioning on the intermediate treatment effect. Models 4 and 5 are most different from models 1, 2, 3. Models 1, 2, and 3 all have groupsize and the WAIC and coeftab, as well as the DAG, indicate the models have the same inference.

You should end up with 9 judge parameters and 20 wine parameters. Given the parameters are scaled, the prior predictive plots show scaled wine scores mostly between -2 and 2. Since we do not have any prior knowledge about how this relationship (positive/negative slopes), we are satisfied with this relatively conservative prior. 6.1.3 Model Use ulam instead of quap to build this model, and be sure to check the chains for convergence.

Wine 19 however was particularly poorly scored. Judges, however, have much more variable scoring with three individuals (judges 1, 2, 5) entirely or almost entirely scoring lower than other judges. The worst scoring judge was judge 5. 6.2 Question 2 Now consider three features of the wines and judges: (1) flight: Whether the wine is red or white. (2) wine.amer: Indicator variable for American wines. (3) judge.amer: Indicator variable for American judges. Use indicator or index variables to model the influence of these features on the scores. Omit the individual judge and wine index variables from Problem 1. Do not include interaction effects yet. Again use ulam, justify your priors, and be sure to check the chains. 6.2.1 Data DT[, scale_score := scale(score)] DT[, index_flight := .GRP, flight] DT[, index_wine_american := .GRP, wine.amer] DT[, index_judge_american := .GRP, judge.amer] n_index_flight &lt;- DT[, uniqueN(flight)] n_index_wine_american &lt;- DT[, uniqueN(index_wine_american)] n_index_judge_american &lt;- DT[, uniqueN(index_judge_american)] n_rows &lt;- DT[, .N] q2_data &lt;- c( as.list(DT[, .(scale_score = as.numeric(scale_score), index_flight, index_wine_american, index_judge_american)]), N_flights = n_index_flight, N_wine_american = n_index_wine_american, N_judge_american = n_index_judge_american, N = n_rows ) 6.2.2 Priors data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_flights; int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_wine_american; int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_judge_american; } parameters{ real alpha; vector[N_flights] beta_flights; vector[N_wine_american] beta_wine_american; vector[N_judge_american] beta_judge_american; real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; } model{ alpha ~ normal(0, 0.2); beta_flights ~ normal(0, 0.5); beta_wine_american ~ normal(0, 0.5); beta_judge_american ~ normal(0, 0.5); sigma ~ exponential(1); } # q2_stan &lt;- &#39;q2_prior.stan&#39; # writeLines(readLines(q2_stan)) # q2_prior &lt;- cmdstan_model(q2_stan) q2_prior_sample &lt;- q2_prior$sample(data = q2_data[c(&#39;N_flights&#39;, &#39;N_wine_american&#39;, &#39;N_judge_american&#39;, &#39;N&#39;)]) ##

You should end up with three different interaction terms in your model. These will be easier to build, if you use indicator variables. Again use ulam, justify your priors, and be sure to check the chains. Explain what each interaction means. Be sure to interpret the model’s predictions on the outcome scale (mu, the expected score), not on the scale of individual parameters. You can use link to help with this, or just use your knowledge of the linear model instead. What do you conclude about the features and the scores? Can you relate the results of your model(s) to the individual judge and wine inferences from Problem 1? 6.3.1 Data DT[, index_interactions := .GRP, .(judge.amer, wine.amer, flight)] n_index_interactions &lt;- DT[, uniqueN(index_interactions)] q3_data &lt;- c( as.list(DT[, .(scale_score = as.numeric(scale_score), index_interactions)]), N_interactions = n_index_interactions, N = n_rows ) 6.3.2 Model data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_interactions; int index_interactions[N]; vector[N] scale_score; } parameters{ real alpha; vector[N_interactions] beta_interactions; real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; } model{ alpha ~ normal(0, 0.2); beta_interactions ~ normal(0, 0.25); sigma ~ exponential(1); vector[N] mu; mu = alpha + beta_interactions[index_interactions]; scale_score ~ normal(mu, sigma); } # q3_stan &lt;- &#39;q3.stan&#39; # writeLines(readLines(q3_stan)) # q3_model &lt;- cmdstan_model(q3_stan) q3_sample &lt;- q3_model$sample(data = q3_data) ## Running MCMC with 4 sequential chains... ## ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1 / 2000 [ 0%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 100 / 2000 [ 5%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 200 / 2000 [ 10%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 300 / 2000 [ 15%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 400 / 2000 [ 20%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 500 / 2000 [ 25%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 600 / 2000 [ 30%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 700 / 2000 [ 35%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 800 / 2000 [ 40%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 900 / 2000 [ 45%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%] (Warmup) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1100 / 2000 [ 55%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1300 / 2000 [ 65%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1500 / 2000 [ 75%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1700 / 2000 [ 85%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 1900 / 2000 [ 95%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%] (Sampling) ## Chain 1 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue: ## Chain 1 Exception: normal_lpdf: Scale parameter is 0, but must be positive!

Median age → marriage rate → divorce rate, Median age → divorce rate 11.3 Example: Age, marriage, divorce \\(D_{i} \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma)\\) \\(\\mu_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta_{M}M_{i} + \\beta_{A}A_{i}\\) (M)arriage rate (A)ge at marriage (D)ivorce rate 11.3.1 Priors Standardize to z-scores \\(\\alpha\\) = expected value for response when all values are 0. since they are all standardized the response should be 0. Without peaking at the data, this could be hard to guess. But after standardization, it is much simpler. Slopes - use prior predictive simulation. Harder. 11.3.2 Prior predictive simulation See Prior predictive distributions 11.3.3 Interpretation Once we know median age at marriage, there is little additional value in knowing marriage rate. Once we know marriage rate, there is still value in knowing median age at marriage. If we don’t know median, it is still useful to know marriage rate, since median age at marriage is related to marriage rate. However, we don’t want to try and influence eg. policy on marriage rate, since it isn’t causal on divorce rate. 11.4 Plotting multivariate posteriors Regress predictor on other predictors Compute predictor residuals Regress outcome on residuals Side note: never analyze the residuals. 11.4.1 Posterior predictive checks Compute implied predictions for observed cases Again, regressions will always do well in the area around the mean 11.5 Reveal masked associations Sometimes association between outcome and predictor is masked by another variable This tends to arise when 2 predictors associated with the outcome have opposite effects on it 11.6 Categorical variables Two approaches: Use dummy/indicator variables Use index variables Index variables are much better 11.6.1 Dummy variable “Stand in” variable Eg. male/female column, translated to 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 where 0 female, 1 male Model: \\(h_{i} \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma)\\) \\(\\mu_{i} = \\alpha + \\beta_{M}M_{i}\\) In the case of dummy variables, alpha is the mean when M = 0 (female) and beta M is the change in mean when M = 1 (male). Result is 2 intercepts = where alpha alone is for female and alpha + beta M is intercept for males Problem: for k categories, need k-1 dummy variables and need priors for each. also, priors aren’t balanced because of alpha vs beta "],["lecture-06.html", "12 Lecture 06 12.1 Index variable 12.2 Four elemental confounds", " 12 Lecture 06 12.1 Index variable (For unordered, categorical variables) Starts at 1, counts up Same prior can be given to all Extends easily &gt; 2 eg. m &lt;- quap( alist( height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), mu &lt;- a[sex], a[sex] ~ dnorm(178, 20), sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) ), data = d ) a[sex] and a for each sex and prior for each. directly in precis(m) too.

Arrows indicate causation, and statistical information can flow either way. 12.2.1 Notes Regression models don’t have arrows like DAGs - they just measure associations. You can’t tell the difference between the fork and the path given the data alone. Remember DAGs are small world constructs. 12.2.2 The fork X ← Z → Y Z is a common cause of X and Y. Including Z will remove the relationship between X and Y. 12.2.3 The path X → Z → Y Z is along the path of X and Y, mediating the relationship. For example, the influence of treatment on plant height, where treatment has an influence on fungus. T → F → H Since the treatment influences the fungus (a post treatment measure), if we include both the treatment and the fungus, we will see no relationship of treatment on height, only fungus. (once we know fungus, what does treatment tell us - nothing). In this case, the model with both treatment and fungus tells us the relationship between them, but to properly consider the influence of treatment we need to omit fungus Therefore, understanding the relationship between T and F is important, but for determining causality of T on H, we need to omit it from that model. 12.2.4 The collider X → Z ← Y Z is common result of X and Y. X and Y are independent, if you condition on Z. Careful about statistical correlations that do not indicate causation here. 12.2.5 Steps List all paths connecting X (treatment) and Y (outcome) Classify each path as either open or closed. All paths are open unless they contain a collider. Classify each path as backdoor/frontdoor. Backdoor paths have an arrow entering X. Condition on variables in backdoor paths to close them.

They can create confounds, without being directly measured. Eg. (Haunted DAG). G on C. G → P → C, G → C. But unobserved variable U creates a collider: G → P ← U → C. So including P allows the collider to distort the influence on G on C. 13.2 Over fitting Ockham’s razor: “plurality should never be posited without necessity” This isn’t sufficient, because we are usually comparing between models that are more complicated but fit the data better, and models that are less complicated but fit worse. Two major hazards: too simple, not learning enough from data (under fitting) and too complex, learning too much from data (over fitting) Goal = to learn from regular features from the sample, those that will generalize to other samples 13.3 Measuring model fit 13.3.1 R squared Common, not great \\(R_{2} = 1 - \\frac{var(residuals)}{var(outcome)}\\) “Proportion of variance explained” You can get R squared = 1 with a parameter for each data point - perfect fit. This is obviously nonsense. Therefore there’s a trap of picking models solely on their R squared because increase the parameters and you will increase the R squared. 13.4 Obtaining the regular features Regularizing priors Cross validation Information criteria "],["lecture-08.html", "14 Lecture 08 14.1 Information theory 14.2 Divergence 14.3 Estimating divergence 14.4 Regularization 14.5 Cross validation 14.6 Information criteria 14.7 Model selection 14.8 Model comparison", " 14 Lecture 08 14.1 Information theory Information: reduction in uncertainty caused by learning an outcome Therefore it’s a scale of uncertainty, and information theory is a system for deriving a metric of uncertainty Information entropy: uncertainty in a probability distribution is average the log probability of an event.

Expecting few water events coming from Mars and the reverse coming from Earth Since we don’t actually know the “truth”, we can’t use this to directly measure a model But turns out - we don’t need the truth to compare two models, only their average log probability 14.3 Estimating divergence This is the gold standard for scoring models 14.3.1 Log pointwise predictive density lppd Pointwise measure of average probability that the model expects the data Using the entire posterior, measures the log probability Summing the vector of lppd returns the total log probability score Larger values are better, indicating larger average accuracy 14.3.2 Deviance Deviance = lppd score * -2 Smaller values are better Note: deviance decreases with more parameters, however out of sample deviance is best in the model with the right number of parameters (simulated example) 14.4 Regularization Must always be skeptical of the sample Regularization: use informative, conservative priors to reduce overfitting (models learn less from sample). This is particularly important for small sample sizes and as a result, for multilevel models. 14.5 Cross validation Without known out of sample measures, you can estimate out of sample deviance Model with some samples left out, and average over the estimate of those samples 14.5.1 LOO Leave one out Pareto-smoothed importance sample (PSIS) loo package 14.6 Information criteria Historically: AIC, a theoretical estimate of the KL distance Assumptions of AIC include priors are flat or overwhelmed by data posterior is essentially gaussian sample size &gt;&gt; number of parameters k 14.6.1 WAIC Widely Applicable Information Criterion Does not assume gaussian posterior 14.6.2 Standard error Presented in rethinking::compare and available for LOO or AIC comparisons. The standard error is the approximate standard error of each WAIC. Caution: with small sample sizes, the standard error reported underestimates the uncertainty. To determine if two models can be distinguished, use the standard error of their difference (dSE). Using the compare function, you can get the @dSE slot to return a matrix of dSE for each pair of models. 14.7 Model selection Avoid model selection Score models and apply causal inference to use compare competing models to explain 14.8 Model comparison Model comparison is not causal inference Add and imagine unobserved confounds 14.8.1 Example 1: model mis-selection using WAIC Height 0 → Height 1, Treatment → Fungus → Height 1 F + T, dWAIC = 0 T, dWAIC = 41 intercept = 44 Since f is a pipe on T→F, including it confounds the model AIC does not indicate causal inference, it simply identifies the best model according to the predicted out of sample deviance Model comparison AND causal inference are important 14.8.2 Example 2: primate lifetime Body mass → lifespan, Body mass → brain size → lifespan Relationship of interest: brain size on lifespan M + B, WAIC = 217 B, WAIC = 218 M = 229 Note: when we have different parameters that return similar WAIC, it’s an invitation to poke inside! Inspecting their estimate posterior we notice that the sign of the brain mass parameter flips from negative to positive across models Another approach: since WAIC is pointwise we can plot the difference in WAIC for each point across models Comparing life span on Y, and pointwise difference in WAIC between the two models on X We see that the model M+B is better for some species eg.

Run two linear regressions. This means there is no statistical criteria to measure the split. We are interested in the contrast in slope, but to do that we need to use the same model. Add a categorical variable for Africa? Use alpha[id] and different estimates for each This means the slope is forced to be the same, but difference intercepts.
