## Question 1
The weights listed below were recorded in the !Kung census, but heights were not
recorded for these individuals. Provide predicted heights and 89% compatibility
intervals for each of these individuals. That is, fill in the table below, using
model-based predictions.

```
Individual, weight, expected height, 89% interval
1, 45,,,
2, 40,,,
3, 65,,,
4, 31,,,
5, 53,,,
```

Model:

$h_{i} \sim Normal(\mu_{i}, \sigma)$
$\mu_{i} = \alpha + \beta(x_{i} - \bar{x})$
$\alpha \sim Normal(178, 20)$
$\beta \sim Log-Normal(0, 1)$
$\sigma \sim Uniform(0, 50)$

```{r}
library(rethinking)
data(Howell1)

d <- Howell1[Howell1$age >= 18,]

```
