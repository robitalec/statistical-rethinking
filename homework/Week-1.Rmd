## Variables

N: fixed by experimenter

p: Prior probability

W: A probability distribution given the data. 

## Joint model

W ~ Binomial(N , p)

p ~ Uniform(0, 1)

W is distributed binomially with N observations and probability p on each

p is distributed uniformally at 1

## Question 1

Suppose the globe tossing data (Chapter 2) had turned out to be 4 water in 15
tosses. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. Use the
same flat prior as in the book.


```{r}
# Size of grid for grid approximation
gridsize <- 1000

# Prior grid
prior_grid <- seq(0, 1, length.out = gridsize)

# Prior probability (all 1)
prior_prob <- rep(1, gridsize)

# Data probability
#  given 4/15, using binomial distribution
data_prob <- dbinom(4, 15, prob = vals)

# Calculate the posterior numerator by multiplying prior and data probability
posterior_num <- prior_prob * data_prob
# Standardize by sum of posterior numerator
posterior <- posterior_num / sum(posterior_num)

plot(posterior)
```


## Question 2

Start over in 1, but now use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant
above p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the
Earthâ€™s surface is water. What difference does the better prior make?
